# Chickagotchi

## Background

I created this app so I could get some extra practice with what I have learned so far in Fullstack Academy's Junior Phase.

A few of the concepts that I will demonstrate in this project are:

- Database management using Sequelize and PostgreSQL.
- Node.js and the Express application framework.
- Basic HTML/CSS.

This file assumes a local PostgreSQL database called **'chickagotchi'**. Please make sure to also run `npm install -y` to download all dependencies! The code is set up to send data to your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can type `npm start` in your terminal to run the code.

## List of Key Features at First Launch

- The ability to add any number of chickens to watch after.
- Emojis that update depending on a chicken's age (newborn, chick, adult).
- A fun "Tamagotchi" style interface.
