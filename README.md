# chicken-or-egg-game
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I created this app so I could get some extra practice with what I have learned so far in Fullstack Academy's Junior Phase.</p>
<p>A few of the concepts that I will demonstrate in this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database management using Sequalize and PostgreSQL.</li>
  <li>Node.Js and the Express application framework.</li>
  <li>Basic HTML/CSS.</li>
</ul>
